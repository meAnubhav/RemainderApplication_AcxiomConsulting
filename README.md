Developed an Remainder Application which is used to set remainders. It is basically a computer application built with the help of Java (NetBeans) in front-end and SQL Workbench in Back-end. The application itself has very neat and clean UI which contains almost all needed features, few of them are not working currently but it will be updated in future.

For reference, screenshots are attached above.
